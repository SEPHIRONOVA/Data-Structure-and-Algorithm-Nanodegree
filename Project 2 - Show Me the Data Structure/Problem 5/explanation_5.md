## Explanation_5: Blockchain

_Data Structure:_

- 'Linked List': it connects each block and store their previous hash

_Time Complexity:_

The time complexity for calculating hash is O(1)
The time complexity for append/get_size is O(1)
The time complexity for search the block is O(n)

To sum up, the time complexity is O(n)

_Space Complexity:_
O(n): Number of Blocks
