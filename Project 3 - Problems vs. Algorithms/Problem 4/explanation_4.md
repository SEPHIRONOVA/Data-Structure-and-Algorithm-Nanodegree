## Explanation_4: Dutch National Flag Problem

_Explanation:_
Mergesort is used here as it requires nlog(n) time complexity. 

_Time Complexity:_
O(n) as it only iterate the whole input_list once. 

_Space Complexity:_
O(1) the space complexity is constant as it only requires item swap within a list
