## Explanation_1: Square Root of an Integer

_Explanation:_
As the time complexity is O(log(n)), it is impossible to loop through 1 to n to find the number. Given the choice in the algo, divide the number into parts will satisfy the requirement.

_Time Complexity:_
O(log(n)) Each time divide the value by 2 and try to find the closer half

_Space Complexity:_
O(1) the space complexity is constant
